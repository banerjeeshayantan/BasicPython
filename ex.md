At the end of 2019, an unknown pathogen was first isolated from three people with pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan, China. Scientists later identified it as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It only took 90 days for the highly contagious virus to conquer the whole world. Today, the virus had infected over 197 million people worldwide, and the number of deaths had totaled more than 4.1 million.

As we move into the second year of living with the disease, newer scientific discoveries to fight the virus bring hope. We are now optimistic about the development, equitable distribution, and access to safe COVID-19 vaccines to provide acquired immunity against the virus. Around the world, several [different types](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) of potential vaccines are in development. If you are still getting vaccinated, bookmark this article, open a new tab and register for the closest available vaccine slot. The potential benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks. The internet is flooded with news reports of infection among unvaccinated people ([here](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187), [here](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/pandemic-of-the-unvaccinated-us-covid-cases-rising-in-all-50-states-121071700094_1.html), and [here](https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2021/07/delta-variant-spurring-uptick-in-covid-19-cases-largely-in-unvaccinated/)). It is imperative on your part to do your bit to protect yourself and your community. According to the Central for Disease Control and Prevention (USA),

Two of the widely implemented COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are:
* The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Approved for people 12 years of age and older)
* The Moderna vaccine (Approved for people 18 years of age and older)

But, even before we talk about the mRNA-based vaccines, what does the transcriptome of a SARS-CoV-2 patient look like? To answer this question, this article has been divided into the following sections: 
* A short primer on RNA
* RNA therapies in general (with a focus on mRNA vaccines)
* The transcriptome

Let’s begin.

### The curious case of the marvelous messenger — RNA

Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) is an important biological macromolecule that is present in our cells. RNA molecules carry essential genetic information and are rightfully dubbed as **messengers**. Chemically it differs from the DNA molecule in three basic aspects:

* RNA is a single-stranded molecule as opposed to double-stranded DNA.
* The sugar-phosphate “backbone” of the RNA molecule (shown in the picture above) is made up of [ribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribose) instead of [deoxyribose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose).
* The complementary base to [adenine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine) in RNA is [uracil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil) instead of [thymine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine).

Here’s a quick rundown on the different types of RNA molecules that is relevant to this article:

### The translators:
* mRNA (messenger RNA): transfers information from the genes to the ribosome where proteins are made.
* rRNA (ribosomal RNA): forms the primary component of ribosomes and catalyzes the assembly of amino acids into protein chains.
* tRNA (transfer RNA): decodes the information present in the mRNA and helps add amino acids to a protein chain.  
*(I would encourage the reader to read up on the other types of RNA molecules not covered here: micro RNA, small nuclear RNA, small nucleolar RNA, and long intervening non-coding RNA)*
