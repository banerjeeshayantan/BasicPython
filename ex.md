At the end of 2019, an unknown pathogen was first isolated from three people with pneumonia-like symptoms in Wuhan, China. Scientists later identified it as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It only took 90 days for the highly contagious virus to conquer the whole world. Today, the virus had infected over 197 million people worldwide, and the number of deaths had totaled more than 4.1 million.

As we move into the second year of living with the disease, newer scientific discoveries to fight the virus bring hope. We are now optimistic about the development, equitable distribution, and access to safe COVID-19 vaccines to provide acquired immunity against the virus. Around the world, several [different types](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) of potential vaccines are in development. If you are still getting vaccinated, bookmark this article, open a new tab and register for the closest available vaccine slot. The potential benefits of vaccination far outweigh the potential risks. The internet is flooded with news reports of infection among unvaccinated people ([here](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-941fcf43d9731c76c16e7354f5d5e187), [here](https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/pandemic-of-the-unvaccinated-us-covid-cases-rising-in-all-50-states-121071700094_1.html), and [here](https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2021/07/delta-variant-spurring-uptick-in-covid-19-cases-largely-in-unvaccinated/)). It is imperative on your part to do your bit to protect yourself and your community. According to the Central for Disease Control and Prevention (USA),

Two of the widely implemented COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are:
* The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Approved for people 12 years of age and older)
* The Moderna vaccine (Approved for people 18 years of age and older)

But, even before we talk about the mRNA-based vaccines, what does the transcriptome of a SARS-CoV-2 patient look like? To answer this question, this article has been divided into the following sections: 
* A short primer on RNA
* RNA therapies in general (with a focus on mRNA vaccines)
* The transcriptome

Letâ€™s begin.
